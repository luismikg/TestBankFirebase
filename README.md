In this project I applied my skills in building layouts and navigation files, also I explored different Firebase tools like real-time database, storage, and authentication. All of those building a Banking app. 

* __user for test:__ stori@gmail.com
* __pass:__ 123456

The app is built with sex screens:

* Splash
* Login
* Register
* Onboarding (take identification photo and success screen)
* Home screen (balance information and list of movements)
* Movement detail
